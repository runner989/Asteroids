# Asteroids

Asteroids clone using PyGame.

## How To Play

To play the game, open a terminal (or command line window) and type:  
` python main.py `

You can move around:  
- use "a" and "d" to rotate your spaceship
- use "w" to accelerate
- use "s" to move backwards (reverse thrusters?) 

You can shoot using the "space bar"
- When a bullet hits a big asteroid, it breaks it into two medium sized ones.  
- When a bullet hits a medium sized asteroid, it breaks it into two small ones.  
- When a bullet hits a small asteroid, it destroys it completely  

### TO DO:

- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
